## 🛠️ Devblog May 29th OpenMP, Deathlist & DebugHell

Today’s entry is a spicy cocktail of **DeathList redesign, OpenMP migration, and a bucketload of compiler tantrums.** What began as a simple update turned into a holy crusade against untagged variables, deprecated functions, and the eternal battle of `0` vs. `false`.

---

### 💀 Deathlist TextDraw System – Now Longer, Stronger, and Ranked in Style
- Fully reworked with `CreateDeathListTD()`.
- Each kill now shifts the list downward with `PushDeathListEntry(playerid, tick)`.
- **Top 3** are color highlighted (for thaat sweet, glorious shame).
- Build in ordinal formtting (1st, 2nd, 3rd and so on) so even in death, you're properly labeled.
- Handles eliminations with `HandlePlayerElimination(playerid)` and wraps up with `HandleRoundWinner(type)`.

> Everyone dies. But not everyone makes the list.

---

### 🧠 Clanwar Scoreboard Logic – Smart, Reactive, and Sassier
- We no dynamiclly update the HUD based on `CWInfo[MapRoundsLeft]`.
- Status string.
 - ***No map selected. Please wait.**
 - **Selecting next map...**
 - **Rounds left: x**
- Seamlessly transitions round-to-round. Cleaner than ever.

---

### ⏱️ New Map Timer – Finally, a Clock!
- Introduced a map-specific timer to Clanwars.
- Tracks overall match duration and round timings.

> We finally have a timer. Took us only 10 years. Now you know how long you’ve been stuck on that one map. Worth it.

---

### 🔁 Map Search Overhaul – Tablist + Filtering
- Implemented `DIALOG_STYLE_TABLIST_HEADERS` with author, mode, and mapname columns.
- Searches `.ini` files from `/RMaps/` dynamically.
- Added full **Search Map** feature to filter maps by partial name input.

---

### 🔥 OpenMP Migration – Welcome to the Shittery
Oh boy. Where do we begin?
We switched the engine from SA-MP to OpenMP and all hell broke loose:
- `if(0)`? Now needs to be `if(false)`.
- `TextDrawColor`? Nah, it's `TextDrawColour` now. British server confirmed.
- `TogglePlayerControllable(playerid, 1);` → **tag mismatch**
- Use `true` instead. Apparently, 1.0 is too ambiguous for this brave new world.

---

### 🤕 The Migration Warnings That Haunted Us
`warning 213: tag mismatch`
`warning 234: function is deprecated (GetPlayerPoolSize)`
`error 025: function heading differs from prototype` 
"Bro you forgot the enum tag on 'reason' again..."

We slapped on every fix possible:
```pawn
#define NO_TAGS
#define MIXED_SPELLINGS
#include <open.mp>
#pragma warning disable 213
```

---

### 🧪 Runtime Errors & Logs of Doom
> "Status 406 socket read timed out" [Info] This won’t affect server behavior. 
Well thank god, because after that refactor we were this close to switching careers.
Also:
- `GetPlayerPoolSize()` → `MAX_PLAYERS`

---

### 🧼 The Cleaners: Reset & Round Control
- `ResetDeathList()` wipes the board between rounds.
- `HandlePlayerElimination()` manages active deaths.
- `HandleRoundWinner(type)` closes each round based on live counts.
Basically, the round system is now smarter, clearer, and battle-tested.

---

### 🌟 Achievement System Preview – Sneak Peek from the CW Server
We also previewed the early concept for our upcoming Achievement System, destined for the main server.
Deployed and tested a basic prototype on the CW server.
- Includes dynamic TextDraws for titles, rewards, and earned achievements.
- Fully integrated with sound feedback
- This system is still in its infancy but it’s already looking spicy. Expect more on this soon.
