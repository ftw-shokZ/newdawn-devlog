> Upon this craft, forged not in idle days.  
> With code as quill and will as fire,  
> I’ve wrought a server to inspire."*

Thus begins my humble chronicle — a dev’s tale of pixels, packets, and persistence.  
Join me as I unveil the makings of **New Dawn Clanwar Server 2.5**: rebuilt, refined, and reborn.

## ✅ Clanwar Login System — Fully Modernized

---

### 🔒 Login System Redesign
A brand-new textdraw-based login interface replaces old dialogs:
- Interactive password input
- PlayerTextDraw-based confirmation buttons
- Clean immersive layout

---

### 📸 Cinematic Login Experience
- Rewritten `LoginCameraScreen()` with animated camera transitions
- Randomized scene paths for variation
- Continuous animation handled by `SetTimerEx`

---

### 🔑 Secure Password Handling
- Passwords are hashed via HTTP using `hash.php` (SHA512)
- Used `OnHashUpdate()` and `HashUpdateQuery()` for verification
- Fully compatible with the latest MySQL plugin (BlueG fork)

---

### 🧠 Account Data Handling
- New `LoadAccountStats()` replaces legacy `LoadStats`
- Efficient stat loading using `cache_get_value_name[_int]()`
- Player data modularized inside `PlayerInfo[]` structure

---

### 📊 Stat Preview Before Login
- Added pre-login stat box showing:
  - Score
  - DM Wins
  - Hunters
  - DD Wins
- Powered by `OnAccountPreviewStats()`

---

### 🛠️ Quality of Life Enhancements
- CW Hosts now show up in chat like: `[CW_Host] PlayerName (ID): Message`
- Server-wide chat messages improved with `SendFormatMessageToAll()`
- Added `/changecwstate` for cycling through Clanwar states manually

---

## 🧼 Codebase Cleanup & Structure

- Login camera logic, hashing, UI, and stat updates now live in their own `.inc` files:
- `account_system.inc`
- `hud.inc`
- `utility.inc`
- `textdraws.inc`
- Player data and enums organized in `data.inc`
- Clean separation between camera, MySQL, UI, and gameplay systems
