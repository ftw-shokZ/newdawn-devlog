## üé≠ ACT II ‚Äì Of Rounds, Victors, and Spectres

Lo! Upon the morn of steel and circuit,  
Where bits do clash like blade 'gainst shield,  
The scribes of Dawn hath laid new parchment,  
And breathed new logic into the field.

Forsooth, the ancient scrolls of `clanwar.inc`‚Äîdusty with the weight of elder bytes‚Äî  
Hath been transmuted by Cihan, brave architect of scripts and digital rites.  
Let this post mark the birth of what now doth stir the soul of New Dawn‚Äôs code.

A single function to judge all fate.  
No longer dost chaos and clutter bind thy scores.  
Points are assigned, names declared, and honor restored‚Äî  
Displayed for all on sacred floating text, divine as prophecy in war.

```pawn
public Winner(type)

## ‚öñÔ∏è Judgement of the Fallen ‚Äì `CheckTable`

With solemn grace does the function count  
The brave who falter, the few who fall.  
It knoweth when one side's breath is spent‚Äî  
And crowneth victors with three seconds' lament.

## üõ°Ô∏è Scoreboard Divine ‚Äì `SetScoreBoard`

Lo! The scoreboard, now a tapestry,  
Paints tales of bravery, folly, and might.

One round endeth‚Äîanother comes anon.  
All players restored, their HUDs removed,  
Their souls reset for another run.

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è An Orchestra of Enchantments

From `StartCountDown` to `GameOne`,  
Combat is timed like celestial rhythm.  
Each tick of timer, each glyph in the air,  
Brings us closer to the perfect match.

## üé¨ Curtain Call ‚Äì The `EndGame()` Rises

When final rounds are sung and echoes fade,  
`EndGame()` ascends like thunder breaking dusk.  
Rounds are tallied, victors declared,  
And silence returns to the digital stage.
